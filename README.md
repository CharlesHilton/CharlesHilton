- 👋 Hi, I’m @CharlesHilton
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of stuff, but really like geometry and CAD/graphics related applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to render stuff using Vulkan. OpenGL was fun. Time for a new challenge.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything AI or Gaming related.
